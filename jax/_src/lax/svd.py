"""A JIT-compatible library for QDWH-based SVD decomposition.

QDWH is short for QR-based dynamically weighted Halley iteration. The Halley
iteration implemented through QR decmopositions is numerically stable and does
not require solving a linear system involving the iteration matrix or
computing its inversion. This is desirable for multicore and heterogeneous
computing systems.
